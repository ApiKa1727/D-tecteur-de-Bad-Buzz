Dans une première partie, vous observerez les données et vous vous familiariserez avec le jeu de données.\n","\n","2. Dans une seconde partie, vous nétoyrez le jeu de données en supprimant les données manquantes, en transformant les données textuelles en données numériques (**TF-IDF** pour les tweetes et 1 ou 0 pour les labels) puis en séparant les données en un jeu d'entraînement et un jeu de test.\n","\n","3. Dans une troisième partie, vous construirez un modèle de classification supervisée et vous l'entrainerez sur le jeu d'entraînement, vous évaluerez la performance de votre modèle sur le jeu de test et vous afficherez les résultats.\n","\n","4. Dans une quatrième partie, vous connecterez votre modèle à l'api openai pour répondre aux tweets négatifs détectés par votre moèle via le module ChatCompletion.\n","\n","5.
